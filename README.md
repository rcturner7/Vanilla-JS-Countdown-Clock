# Vanilla-JS-Countdown-Clock


HTML, CSS, JS learning project to build Solana Citizens website.
Go to www.solcitizens.club and click on mint.
You will see a countdown clock, and my personal pixel image I created as background.

This project gives much credit to https://codepen.io/timjackleus/pen/rjmxpW
This was his project to share, and I changed url to my personal background using an image I created and uploaded to IPFS.
Tim Jackleus has great work, and much support to learning html builders in the making, such as myself.
As I learn HTML for my website and projects. I did change and play with the sizing and dimensions in the code for my website and image.

Check in for updates and youtube tutorials on how I brokedown and researched the code to do what I want the project to do for me.
I look forward in to helping people such as myself with no knowledge of programming and coding with ideas and steps on how to learn, understand, and build projects for themselves.
